chat_tasker
===========

This project is a proof of concept implementation of a chat client done using Firebase and AngularJS. 
Becuase this is a purely client side project, it's possible to host right of out your google drive as 
demonstrated on http://goo.gl/Dm1BCX. 

Notes from the developer:
-------------------------
* Currently, the application is EXTREMELY insecure.  
* While a "private" converation is going on, with enough know-how, anyone can see the conversations in progress.
* Yes, private chats are deleted when you leave. (The history is deleted).
